An assertion checks a condition at runtime and traps if it fails.

```motoko no-repl
let n = 10;
assert n % 2 == 1; // Traps
```

```motoko no-repl
let n = 10;
assert n % 2 == 0; // Succeeds
```

Assertions help catch logic errors early, but should not be used for regular [error handling](../errorHandling.md).
